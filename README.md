# Yarn start to load locally, make sure you use the .env file provided by Tyler
test change
## What were the most difficult tasks?
Doing state management without Redux and not using react router. These things would've
been nice to have but I didn't feel like I needed them given the scope of the project.

## Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?
I learned how to use ENV files with Create React App, turns out it's pretty simple.

## What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?
I wish I could've added a more satsifying confirm button. Also a seperate page to confirm the movies on instead of a modal.

What took up most of my time was figuring out how to use the API.

## How could the application be improved?
I'd refactor this with Redux and react router. This codebase cannot scale as it is. There's too much prop drilling and navigation is based on state instead of making use of the URL.
